            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
			As a passionate and dedicated AI and computer science enthusiast, I am on a relentless journey to explore the limitless possibilities of artificial intelligence. My profound interest in this dynamic field led me to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering, where I achieved an exceptional CGPA of 17 on a 20-point scale.
			</p>
			<br>
            <p>
			My academic journey has been enriched by hands-on experience and significant accomplishments in AI competitions. I had the privilege of participating in two prestigious national AI competitions hosted by INEF, where I showcased my problem-solving skills and technical expertise. In my first competition, I secured the 4th position with the 'Driving Cycle' project, demonstrating my ability to apply Data Science techniques to real-world challenges. Subsequently, I achieved an impressive 2nd position in Iran by developing a real-time pricing web application, underlining my proficiency in AI and Data Management.
			</p>
			<br>
            <p>
			One of the most significant achievements in my journey was becoming a member of INEF (Iran's National Elite Foundation), a testament to my dedication and excellence in the field of AI. This honor reflects my profound passion and exceptional aptitude in the field, showcasing my relentless pursuit of excellence in the realm of AI.
			</p>
			<br>
            <p>
			Now, as I aspire to pursue advanced studies in computer science and AI at graduate level, I am eager to delve deeper into cutting-edge research, learn from distinguished faculty, and collaborate with peers who share my passion. I am excited to embark on this next chapter of my academic journey, where I aim to make meaningful contributions to the field of AI and drive innovation in the world of technology.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>Final year B.Sc. student in Computer Engineering from Islamic Azad University with an impressive CGPA of 17 on a 20-point scale, 3.4 on a 4-point scale.</p>
        </div>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
        Engaged in two prestigious national AI competitions hosted by INEF. Secured 4th position in the first competition with the 'Driving Cycle' project, and achieved an impressive 2nd position in Iran with a real-time pricing web application. Driving cycles are standardized patterns replicating real-world driving scenarios, crucial in vehicle testing for evaluating fuel efficiency, emissions, and performance. They enable manufacturers to design vehicles meeting regulatory standards and consumer expectations by closely aligning with actual usage patterns. Our micro trip-based cycle, from Enghelab Square to Tajrish Square, involved data collection through onboard measurement, followed by data filtration. The cycle comprised three clusters (Congested, Urban, and Highway) and spanned 1500 seconds.
    </p>
	<br>
    <p>
        In the real-time pricing project for Rightell, we developed a web application to predict cellular packages, including messages and internet prices. Our application utilized web mining to gather pricing packages from rival companies, storing them in a database. We ranked 2nd in Iran and consequently I became a member of INEF (Iran's National Elite Foundation) which is one of the highest titles a student can achieve in Iran.
    </p>
	<br>
    <p>
        One of my notable achievements is the Smart Bag project, where I co-invented an electrical board that can be installed on any bag. Leveraging RFID technology, it checks for necessary items, while an LCD displays what is missing. This innovation reflects my proficiency in CodeVisionAVR, Proteus, and C, as well as my soft skills in teamwork and passion. This project earned first place in my province and was recognized in the <a href="https://article.tebyan.net/372425" target="_blank">Tebyan and Khwarizmi Youth Awards</a>.

			<h2>Books</h2>
			<p>I prefer to start by reading books rather than taking courses. I then supplement this learning by exploring additional content, both in written and video formats, available on the internet.</p>
			<p>Here are some of the books that have significantly contributed to my knowledge and understanding:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R" by G. James, D. Witten, T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani - My inaugural dive into the world of AI. This book not only demystified Machine Learning models but also honed my mathematical understanding, setting the foundation for my career.</li>
				<li>"Linear Algebra and Its Applications" by David C Lay, Judi J. McDonald, and Steven R Lay - This book, with its straightforward approach and focused exercises, played a pivotal role in building my AI basics.</li>
				<li>"Practical Natural Language Processing" by Vajjala, Majumder, Gupta, and Surana, and "Natural Language Processing in Action" by Lane, Hapke, and Howard - These parallel reads were instrumental in my NLP journey, providing diverse perspectives on the subject.</li>
				<li>"Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Sutton - Complementing online resources, this book propelled my understanding of RL into deeper realms.</li>
				<li>"Designing Machine Learning Systems" by Chip Huyen - A standout read of the year! Prior to this, ML Systems were uncharted territory for me. This comprehensive book not only demystified the subject but sparked a keen interest that now shapes my research endeavors.</li>	
			</ul>
			<p>Note: While I've delved into other notable books like "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow et al., "Pattern Recognition" by Bishop, and "AI: A Modern Approach" by Norvig and Russel, given their widespread popularity in the AI community, I kept it short for these ones.</p>
